I am Physicist from Universidad de Antioquia (B.S.) and Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (M.S. - Ph.D.). My main interests are Dynamical Systems theory and applications and Plasma Physics research. During my post-docs I have also researched modal coupling for Atmospheric Dynamics and numerical methods applied to Chaotic Dynamics.

Currently I work as a post-doc researcher in Ressacada de Pesquisas em Meio Ambiente at Universidade de Santa Catarina (Brazil). My activities mainly involve the development of the numerical simmulators for the advection in porous mediums and other related problems in Soil Physics.

This site is intended to share information that I consider valuable and might provide insight for other scientists that require more advanced programming tools for their survival in non-academic environments, or maybe improving their workflow in academic research. I am not a professional programmer, so, take everything you read with a grain of salt. If you have important observations please kindly proceed to the discussion section.

Happy survival coding!
