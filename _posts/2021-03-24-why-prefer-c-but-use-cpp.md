My first experience with programming was with C, the language of choice in 2005 for the introductory course in computational physics at my Alma Mater. By the end of the course there was a short mention of C++, Python and OOP, but I was not very interested in computational physics and I mostly forgot the language syntaxis. Since I was mainly focused in academic research, my language of choice was not very influential on my everyday activities, I used mostly Mathematica and some Python for scripting, but as computations became more demmanding I started migrating some of my Mathematica code to Python with no much improvement in performance and a huge penalty in usability. At the time I was requiring some uncommon level of control over numerical integration routines, and this lead me to the [GSL libary](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), which is implemented in C following the guidelines of the GNU software foundation. The excelent [documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/index.html) of GSL and its usage became my informal programming education.
