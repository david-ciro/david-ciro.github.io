My first experience with programming was with C, the language of choice in 2005 for the introductory course in computational physics at my Alma Mater. By the end of the course there was a short mention of C++, Python and OOP, but I was not very interested in computational physics and I mostly forgot the syntaxis. Since I was mainly focused in academic research, the language of choice was not very influential on my everyday activities, I used mostly Mathematica and some Python for scripting, but as computations became more demmanding I started migrating some of my Mathematica code to Python with no much improvement in performance and a huge penalty in usability.
